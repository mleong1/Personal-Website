        <h1 class="aboutMeTitle">About Me</h1>
        <p1>I started seriously programming in college when I found out about a computer science course from a friend.
        Ever since I've liked the challenge of the inherent puzzle solving of programming. I also like the feeling of a successful
        run of something that I wrote myself. I am most interested in the way technology shapes social interaction and in
        some cases adds new social interaction. In my free time I run, I play guitar (still learning), and I try to play
        Melee with my friends when I can.</p1>
